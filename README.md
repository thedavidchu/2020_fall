# 2020_Fall

Code that I have written/ used for the Fall semester of EngSci Year 3.


## Apology
Hi yeah, so I know that the code for ECE324 is a hot mess. Sorry. There was a lot of starter code given-- so for copyright purposes, not my code. Also, there were specific formats of code that were required for submission; hence the unnecessarily long scripts without any hierarchy that make me quite sad.

The latter ECE367 code gives a better overview of my work. I guess this is cherry-picking, but still. Also, I wrote it in Python's NumPy. Sorry.

## Lessons Learned
Going into next semester, I am going to better plan my code layout. I am going to think in terms of Git-- that is, I will start a repository and upload there.
