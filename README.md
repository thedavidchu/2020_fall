# 2020_Fall

Code that I have written/ used for the Fall semester of EngSci Year 3.

N.B. Much of the ECE324 code was given as starter code. That is, much of Problem Set 3 is not my code.

## Apology and Disclaimer
Hi yeah, so I know that the code for ECE324 is a hot mess. Sorry. There was a lot of starter code given-- so for copyright purposes, not my code. Also, there were specific formats of code that were required for submission; hence the unnecessarily long scripts without any hierarchy that make me quite sad.

The latter ECE367 code gives a better overview of my work. I guess this is cherry-picking, but still. Also, I wrote it in Python's NumPy. Sorry.

I do not guarantee that any code works. In fact, ECE324's Problem Set 4 likely does not work out of the box. This is because I wrote the code in two sections for debugging purposes and threw the pieces together for the submission. 

The ECE367 labs should work out of the box. They are small enough that they are just little pieces of code with not too much file structure.

Finally, if you are a sleep-deprived EngSci looking for answers, my reports cost extra. :P Just kidding, no they don't. I just don't have them handy.

## Lessons Learned
Going into next semester, I am going to better plan my code layout. I am going to think in terms of Git-- that is, I will start a repository and upload there.
